One question I get asked a lot when I tell people that I work from home is, ‘How do you get anything done?’, which is of course, a totally fair question. The truth is, at first, I didn’t work so effectively at home. I had to learn the hard way that if I wanted to enjoy the freedom that working from home offers, I would need to stay focused and get sh*t done! Otherwise the deadlines stack up and the weekends disappear. I’ve also learned that productivity, like any habit, requires consistency and follow-through to be sustainable.

I’m very fortunate to have the option to work from home at this time in my career and while it’s not an ideal environment for everyone, most folks will find themselves working from home occasionally. Over the years I’ve figured out what works for me and I thought it would be helpful to share some of the simple ways I stay focused and productive while I’m working chez moi. _Let’s take a look!_

**1| GET OUTSIDE**

***

This might sound a bit counter intuitive since you’ll be _leaving_ the very space you’re meant to be productive in but I find it really helpful. Whether it’s taking the dog out, going for a run, dropping kids off at school, heading to a morning yoga class, grabbing a coffee or a walking meditation, it really helps to get out of the house at the start of the day.

I think of this step as the ‘going to work’ part of my routine. In a way I’m arriving at the office. When you don’t have the buffer zone of a commute that lets your mind to get into work mode this helps achieve that. It also forces you to get out of your pyjamas and get dressed! Speaking of which…

**2 | GET DRESSED**

***

This is one you’ll hear from a lot of professionals that work from home. If you’re not going to leave the house before getting to work then this is the next best thing. It doesn’t mean doing your hair and makeup (although I say go for it!) but it does mean pulling on a clean shirt and a pair of jeans for the day ahead.

Getting dressed signals that you’re prepared for the day in a way that staying in a house coat just doesn’t achieve. Are there days when 4pm hits and I’m still in my jammers, sure, but those are few and far between at this point. Plus, this way, if someone pops by or you need to run out for supplies or an errand you’re all set to go.

**3 | SET BOUNDARIES ON DISTRACTION ZONES**

***

I feel like I could write a whole post about the importance of limiting distractions. The most obvious one being our cell phones. This has been the most ruthless productivity killer for me. Literal HOURS used to evaporate as I aimlessly scrolled on Instagram and it’s just not a good use of time! Not to mention the headspace I’d find myself in afterwards. Yikes!

Even if social media is part of your job, it’s important to set very clear boundaries for phone use and get a grip on just how much you really _need_ to use those platforms day-to-day. Here are a few ways to do this:

* Use the screen time settings to limit your use.
* Put your phone in another room.
* Turning it off or delete the apps you feel are causing the most distraction.
* Plan and strategize off screen so when you do go to open an app you have a plan for the content you want to share. I always sketch out my stories, gather my links and even jot down copy before I reach for my phone.

**4 | MAKE LISTS THE DAY BEFORE**

***

This is a great habit to get into if you’re prone to anxiety the way I am. To combat this, at the end of the work day I will simply jot down my tasks for the following day. I make the list specific and include an approximate amount of time for each task.

For instance, instead of just ‘edit photos’ I will write:

* ‘select images (15 min)’
* ‘adjust in photoshop (1 hr)’

I also break down my blog post prep and follow-through into small jobs like:

* ‘upload all photos (5 min)’
* ‘assign links (1hr)’
* ‘prep newsletter (15 min)’
* ‘pin images to pinterest (10 min)’

For me, breaking large jobs into smaller tasks helps me stay motivated and feel satisfied that I’m making progress as I tick things off the list. When I put blanket tasks on my list like ‘Prep post for Wednesday’ I end up feeling overwhelmed and tend to procrastinate more.

_PS. I love my_ [**_Yearly Task Planner from Appointed_**](https://www.appntd.com/collections/calendars-planners/products/2019-year-task-planner-charcoal)_. This is my second year using one and it’s the best!_

**5 | SET A TIMER**

***

A lot of folks swear by the [**Pomodoro technique**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) for productivity and I use something fairly similar. I like to just set the timer app on my phone (I use Siri to set the time so I’m not lured into checking other apps) and set the amount of time I’d like to get a task completed in.

For instance, email replies can really eat into my day (and energy) so I set 10 min timers to respond to important ones. I get my draft email poured out as quick as I can then edit as needed. Once the timer goes off I’m usually ready to hit send.

The same theory applies to setting an end time for the day. Working from home it’s so easy to let your work hours bleed into the evening and then all of a sudden it’s 9:00pm and you haven’t eaten dinner. When I stop earlier (I aim for 7:00pm) and sign out of my work day officially, I find I can sleep better and hit the ground running instead of feeling run-down the next morning.

**6 | GET COMFY**

When I’m staring down a long day or night at my desk I like to make sure I’m going to be comfortable. I usually have a pillow or two on my chair, a sheepskin at my feet to keep cozy and a candle ready to burn nearby. Oh and a hot cup of tea never hurts either. These little luxuries at my desk help ease the stress of deadlines and create a space that feels comforting while I churn through photo edits, bookkeeping or other tasks that simply need to get done.

**7 | CHANGE OF SCENE**

***

Cabin fever is real. Trust me, after years of working from home and living through Ontario winters going stir crazy is not uncommon. A change of scene doesn’t always mean a big relocation though. Sometimes I’ll grab my laptop and work on the dining room table instead of in my office. Weather permitting I’ll work outside in the yard on a blanket or bench. Some days I just need a couch work session and that’s ok too (I just try to keep that to Fridays and weekends). If I really need a fresh environment I’ll take my laptop to a local café or I might go for a long walk with Dobby to clear my head.

I also like to break my day up a bit so I’m not sitting at my computer for 8 hours straight. I’ll give myself 15 minutes here and there to clean up the kitchen or change over laundry. Small jobs that get me up and down stairs and out of a chair are so important.

**8 | HAVE SNACKS HANDY**

***

This might seem obvious but I find one of the worst productivity hurdles for me is hunger. If I let myself get hungry without realizing it I find my focus wavers and I end up making mistakes or having to do things over. Having some healthy, quick to prepare snacks on hand makes it much easier to maintain my train of thought and stay on task, particularly on shoot days. I keep almonds at the ready, hummus and peppers in the fridge and I love [**this recipe**](https://minimalistbaker.com/no-bake-pb-j-energy-bites/) for power balls.

**9 | CLEAR SOME SPACE**

***

I’m the type that needs to start the day with a clear workspace. Knowing this, I try to end my day with a quick tidy of my desk or wherever I’ve been working and clean-up around the house. Of course, I don’t always follow-through so sometimes I start my day with a clean-up instead. Either way it’s an important way to honour the space I’m going to be working in and I find I get some good thinking done while I’m organizing too.

**10 | ADJUST YOUR EXPECTATIONS**

***

This might look a little different for everyone but for me creativity, productivity and motivation all come and go in waves. During times of heightened motivation I can feel as though I’ll always be productive and during down times it can feel as though every task is a massive chore.

I think that for women who working from home especially, it’s important to keep an eye on your mood and cycle and consider how your hormones might be impacting your energy and workflow. I used to ignore a lot of the signals my body would give me and get frustrated about not being consistent in my productivity.

Now I will pencil in the times during my cycle when my energy dips the most and try no to expect myself to be as motivated or productive during those couple of days. This might mean pushing a little harder the week prior or it could be something as simple as planning dinner out on the nights my body has other priorities.
